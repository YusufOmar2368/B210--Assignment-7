This program’s purpose is to calculate how players are distributed across positions for a specific combine year and summarize that distribution as percentages. It produces a clean, shareable results file that describes the position breakdown for that year.
It takes a target year (and optionally an input CSV path and output CSV path), reads the combine dataset with csv.DictReader, automatically finds the year and position columns from the header, and counts how many rows match that year for each position. It outputs a new CSV containing position, count, percent (percent formatted to two decimals), and returns/prints the output file path (or writes just the header if the year has no matching rows).
The core function percent_by_position(year, csv_path, out_path) drives everything: it converts year values with _to_int_year, filters rows to the requested year, stores counts in a dictionary, computes each position’s percent as (count/total)*100, sorts positions by count, and writes the results to the output CSV. The __main__ block parses command-line arguments, chooses defaults when paths aren’t provided, calls the function, and prints a confirmation message after writing the file.
